**Research Topic:** What are the best approaches to OCR and information extraction from PDFs in 2025? 

- **Task 1:** Determine the range of possible use-cases, and whether this impacts the answer. For example, if a user is interested in information retrieval across a wide-range of PDFs, this is likely going to have a different set of trade-offs to being able to precisely extract information from a single PDF in real-time. 
- **Task 2:** Determine a range of interesting benchmarks for each possible use-case. Try to keep the benchmarks practical, and also something that an individual might be able to realistically run. 
- **Task 3:** Determine the top performing solutions across different categories. Focus on:
    1. accuracy
    2. time-to-complete calculation
    3. resource requirements to run
    4. whether the solution is open or closed source 
For accuracy, also consider whether bounding boxes are provided for the location of each text. For resource requirements, give some brief discussion as well around infrastructure needs. 
- **Task 4:** Determine whether there is the potential for fine tuning any of these solutions on more specialized use-cases e.g. SECC filings. And determine the tools that would likely be required for this if so.
