# OCR and PDF Information Extraction Approaches in 2025

## Diverse Use Cases and Their Impact on Approach

OCR and information extraction from PDFs can serve a variety of use cases, each with different requirements. Two extremes are:

* **Bulk Document Retrieval (Large-Scale)** – For example, indexing a vast library of PDFs to enable search across them. Here the priority is throughput, scalability, and reasonable accuracy **across many documents**. In this scenario, a solution must handle diverse content robustly and cost-effectively. A slight drop in accuracy might be acceptable if it means higher speed and lower cost per page, since overall retrieval performance (finding relevant documents) can tolerate minor OCR errors. Open-source or on-premise solutions are popular here for cost reasons (processing thousands or millions of pages)[[1]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Cto%2520~96). The focus is often on extracting *text for search*, not perfect layout, so bounding boxes and precise formatting may be less critical.
* **Real-Time Single-Document Extraction** – For instance, an interactive application extracting fields from a form or a user scanning one PDF on the fly. Here **precision and speed on the individual document** are paramount. The user expects quick results and high accuracy for that specific PDF. This use case might favor more powerful models or cloud APIs that achieve top accuracy, even if they are heavier, as long as latency is acceptable (usually a few seconds or less). Because only a small number of pages are processed at a time, using a high-end OCR (or even an AI model) can be justified. Cloud services or optimized local models can be used, and the emphasis might include preserving layout or fields exactly (for example, to highlight where each extracted item came from on the page).

Beyond these, other common scenarios include **structured data extraction** (e.g. pulling invoice line items, forms processing), **document understanding** (classifying or summarizing PDF content), and **multilingual or handwriting tasks** (reading documents in various languages or cursive writing). Each scenario may tilt the balance differently between accuracy, speed, and needed features:

* **Structured forms and tables**: Use cases like invoices, receipts, or SEC filings require not just text, but understanding of *which text is a field label vs value, table cell, etc.* This benefits from OCR solutions that preserve layout structure or from specialized models that can perform key-value extraction. Solutions like cloud APIs (Azure Form Recognizer, Amazon Textract) or Transformer-based models (e.g. LayoutLM, Donut) excel here[[2][3]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrengths%3A).
* **Search/Information Retrieval across many PDFs**: Often handled by first OCR’ing all PDFs into text (and maybe metadata), then indexing the text. The OCR engine must be reliable and support batch processing. Open-source engines (like Tesseract or PaddleOCR) are commonly chosen to avoid per-page fees. These can be run in parallel on multiple CPU/GPU instances to scale out. Accuracy still matters (garbled text can hurt search), but for clean printed text, even free OCR engines now exceed 95% accuracy, making them sufficient[[1]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Cto%2520~96). For very challenging documents (e.g. old scans or decorative layouts), some organizations might selectively employ a more powerful OCR on those subsets.
* **Scanned vs. Born-Digital PDFs**: A crucial branch in approach is whether the PDF has an embedded text layer (born-digital) or is just images of text (scanned). For born-digital PDFs, **no OCR is needed** – the text can be extracted directly using PDF parsing libraries (yielding perfect text accuracy)[[4]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dcommunity.adobe.com.%2520This%2520preserves%2520100%2Cservice%2520will%2520apply%2520OCR%2520automaticall). Solutions like Adobe’s PDF Extract API detect this and use the PDF’s native text when available, preserving 100% of that text without recognition errors[[4]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dcommunity.adobe.com.%2520This%2520preserves%2520100%2Cservice%2520will%2520apply%2520OCR%2520automaticall). In such cases, the challenge is more about layout interpretation (figuring reading order, sections, tables from the PDF’s structure) rather than text recognition. For scanned PDFs (or pages containing only images), OCR is necessary to turn images into text. Many pipelines handle both: for each page, check if text is embedded; if not, apply OCR. This hybrid approach ensures efficiency and accuracy (avoiding redundant OCR on digital text).
* **Multilingual and Handwriting scenarios**: Use cases involving international documents or handwritten notes require OCR engines that support those scripts. Some open-source tools support 80+ languages (e.g. PaddleOCR)[[5]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DPaddleOCR%2520) and Tesseract supports 100+ languages[[6]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Coutput%2520formats%2520such%2520as%2520plain). Handwriting recognition is far more challenging: accuracy can vary widely (20%–95% as per recent evaluations)[[7]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Chave%2520a%2520bit%2520higher%2520accuracy). If a use-case involves significant handwriting (e.g., handwritten forms), specialized services or models might be needed, and throughput might be lower due to complexity.

**Impact on recommended approach:** In summary, wide-range batch processing favors solutions that are **automated, scalable, and cost-effective** (often open-source or self-hosted, possibly trading a small amount of accuracy for speed), whereas precise one-off extraction favors **accuracy and advanced features**, even if that means using heavier models or paid APIs on a case-by-case basis. For instance, if processing an archive of 100,000 pages of clean text, one might choose Tesseract or another free engine to achieve >95% accuracy at no cost[[1]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Cto%2520~96). But if extracting critical data from a single complex legal PDF, a user might call a cloud AI service or an advanced Transformer model to maximize accuracy (98–99%)[[8]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dachieves%2520extremely%2520high%2520text%2520recognition%2CIt%2520handled%2520difficult), accepting the overhead. Often, systems are hybrid: using fast OCR to index everything, and then on-demand applying a finer analysis (or human review) to the top search results or critical documents.

## Practical Benchmarks for OCR and Extraction

To evaluate OCR and PDF extraction approaches, several benchmarks exist – some focusing on raw text recognition, others on structured information extraction. Below are a range of practical benchmarks an individual or team might use:

* **OCR Text Accuracy Benchmarks**: These measure how accurately text is extracted from images or PDFs. A common metric is Character Error Rate or Word Accuracy. For example, the **Industry Documents Library (IDL)** was used in a 2025 OCR study to provide sample documents in categories like printed text (letters, reports), “printed media” (posters with fancy fonts/layouts), and handwriting[[9]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWe%2520used%252030%2520documents%2520of%2C3%2520categories%2520in%2520this%2520benchmark). In that study, all tested solutions exceeded 95% accuracy on simple printed text, but on complex layouts accuracy ranged from ~60% up to ~90%[[1]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Cto%2520~96)[[10]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Chave%2520a%2520bit%2520higher%2520accuracy). An individual could recreate similar tests: e.g., take 30 scanned pages of a book (printed text), 30 pages of magazines or posters (complex print layouts), and run different OCR tools to compare output against ground truth. Tools like **Levenshtein distance** or cosine similarity (as used in the IDL study) can quantify accuracy[[11]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dincluding%2520the%2520correct%2520text%2520in%2Cwas%2520verified%2520twice%2520by%2520humans). Another standard benchmark is the **ICDAR Robust Reading Competition** datasets – for instance, printed OCR (ICDAR 2019) or scene text datasets – though those often cater to scene text; for document OCR, one can use datasets like **OCR-D** or synthetic text benchmarks to measure pure recognition.
* **Layout and Structure Benchmarks**: For PDFs, preserving layout (paragraphs, columns, tables) is important in many cases. Datasets like **PubLayNet** (scientific articles with layout annotations) and **DocBank** provide ground truth for layout detection (heading vs paragraph vs list, etc.). Evaluating an approach on these can show how well it retains structure. For example, one might measure how accurately tables are detected and reproduced. The **ICDAR Table Recognition challenges** and **Document Layout Analysis** benchmarks are relevant: these test how well a solution can identify and reconstruct tables or multi-column text. If an individual wants a practical test, they could take a PDF with tables and see if the OCR output retains the table structure (e.g., CSV output or proper cell separation) – some tools like Amazon Textract or Adobe PDF Extract output tables as structured data, which could be compared to a manually-created CSV for accuracy.
* **Key Information Extraction Benchmarks**: When the goal is to extract specific fields from documents (forms, invoices, etc.), datasets like **FUNSD** (Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents) and **SROIE** (Scanned Receipts OCR and Information Extraction, ICDAR 2019) are widely used. For instance, FUNSD has 199 scanned forms with annotations for form fields and their relationships. SROIE has receipts where the task is to extract key fields like total amount, date, address. These are realistic and small enough for individuals to experiment with. State-of-the-art models on FUNSD (as of 2023–2024) include LayoutLM and Donut – these models have achieved high F1-scores by combining OCR with layout-aware processing[[12]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Ddocument%2520classification%2C%2520or%2520question%2Cthan%2520just%2520looking%2520for%2520keywords)[[13]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L162%2520step%2C%2520Donut%2Ctrainable%2520approach%2520can%2520rival%2520traditional). A practical benchmark run might involve using a pre-trained model (say LayoutLMv2 fine-tuned on FUNSD) and evaluating its F1 or accuracy on the test set, or using an OCR+heuristics approach and comparing field-level accuracy. Similarly, an individual could test invoice extraction by using a few sample invoices: manually label fields and see how well different tools (like Azure’s prebuilt invoice model, or Tesseract + a regex script) capture those fields.
* **Multi-document Retrieval Benchmarks**: For the use-case of retrieving information across many PDFs, one can treat it as an information retrieval (IR) problem. While there aren't standard public “IR on OCR” competitions widely known, one approach is to take a set of documents, define some queries, and measure if the system finds the right document and text. For example, one might use a set of corporate filings and ask questions like “Which document mentions X in context Y?”. The **DocVQA** dataset is an example where given a document and a question, the task is to find the answer from the document – it indirectly tests OCR plus understanding. On a simpler level, a practical measure is indexing a collection of OCRed documents with a search engine (Elasticsearch, etc.) and checking precision/recall for known queries. If the OCR has errors, relevant documents might not be retrieved. Thus, one could compare, say, Tesseract vs Google Vision on a set of 100 documents by seeing how many known facts can be found via full-text search in each OCR output. Another practical benchmark could be to measure **speed**: e.g., how many pages per minute can each method process on given hardware – important for large-scale use. This can be measured by timing each OCR engine on a sample batch of PDFs (ensuring they have similar complexity).
* **Handwriting Benchmarks**: If handwritten documents are in scope, the **IAM Handwriting dataset** or **Bentham Manuscripts** are classical benchmarks for isolated handwriting. More recently, datasets that mix handwriting and print (like certain form understanding sets) can be used. The aimultiple study reported a very wide range in handwriting OCR accuracy (20%–96%) across tools[[7]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Chave%2520a%2520bit%2520higher%2520accuracy), so an individual might test a few handwriting samples (e.g., handwritten notes) on different OCR APIs to see which reads them correctly. This is a more specialized benchmark; many general OCR tools struggle on cursive writing, while some services (Google, Azure, Amazon) have trainable or specialized handwriting modes.

Importantly, benchmarks should be **practical** for an individual: the above-mentioned datasets (FUNSD, SROIE, DocVQA, etc.) are publicly available and come with some ground truth, making them suitable for experimentation. Even without formal datasets, one can create a mini-benchmark: pick a few representative documents for each use case of interest (a clean page of text, a form, a receipt, a presentation slide with mixed layout, etc.), run multiple OCR solutions, and manually check results for errors, speed, and output richness. This hands-on evaluation often illuminates the trade-offs (e.g., one tool might get all characters right but output them jumbled out of order, while another preserves order but misses a word). In short, practical benchmarks span from measuring pure text accuracy to assessing structured output correctness, under conditions that reflect the intended use scenario (bulk vs single, simple vs complex layout, etc.).

## Top Performing Solutions in 2025: Accuracy, Speed, Resources, and Openness

OCR technology in 2025 spans from battle-tested open-source engines to cutting-edge AI models and cloud-based services. The *“best”* approach depends on what “best” means for you – raw accuracy, speed, low resource usage, cost, or capability to extract structured info. Here we break down the top solutions by category, noting (i) their accuracy, (ii) speed/throughput, (iii) resource requirements, (iv) openness, and (v) whether they provide extras like bounding boxes (location of text):

### Open-Source OCR Engines (Traditional and Neural)

* **Tesseract OCR** – The long-standing open-source engine (originated at HP, now Google-maintained) remains widely used. It’s free, supports 100+ languages out-of-the-box[[6]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Coutput%2520formats%2520such%2520as%2520plain), and with its LSTM-based engine (since version 4) it achieves high accuracy on clean, printed text (often 95%+ character accuracy on good scans)[[14]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dof%2520the%2520box%29%2520unstract%2Ccom). Tesseract can output plain text or HTML-based formats (hOCR/ALTO) that include bounding boxes for words/lines[[15]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dto%2520improve%2520recognition%2520unstract), enabling downstream highlighting or layout reconstruction. It’s highly **customizable** – you can train new language models or fine-tune it on specific fonts[[16]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L263%2520%2Ccustomizable%2520for%2520specialized%2520OCR%2520needs), making it adaptable for unusual scripts or OCR-ing things like old typewriter documents (with some effort in preparing training data). **Accuracy**: On straightforward documents, Tesseract is on par with some commercial tools[[14]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dof%2520the%2520box%29%2520unstract%2Ccom). However, it struggles with complex layouts (multicolumn pages, forms) and with low-quality or noisy images[[17]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dpreserve%2520complex%2520layout%2520structure%2520like%2Cto%2520powering%2520search%2520in%2520archives). It also isn’t great with handwriting. **Speed**: Tesseract is CPU-based and can be multi-threaded. It’s reasonably fast for small jobs (a few seconds per page on a modern CPU), but for huge volumes you’d distribute the work across cores/servers. It has modest memory usage per instance. **Resource Req.**: No GPU needed; runs on anything from Raspberry Pi to servers. This makes it easy to deploy but also means it doesn’t benefit from GPU acceleration – purely CPU-bound. **Open/Closed**: Fully open-source (Apache 2.0 license). **Extras**: It does basic page layout analysis (finding blocks of text) but doesn’t preserve complex formatting – if you need tables or exact layout, you must reconstruct that from the spatial data. In short, Tesseract is ideal when you need a free, offline solution with solid basic OCR accuracy and are willing to trade off some advanced layout handling[[18]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520summary%2C%2520the%2520best%2520OCR%2Cdepends%2520on%2520your%2520specific%2520needs).
* **PaddleOCR** – An open-source toolkit from Baidu, PaddleOCR has emerged as a top performer in the open realm. It’s a deep learning-based system with text detection and recognition models, supporting 80+ languages like Chinese, Arabic, Latin scripts, etc.[[5]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DPaddleOCR%2520). **Accuracy**: PaddleOCR is generally **very high accuracy**, often beating Tesseract on difficult cases. In one comparison on a form image, PaddleOCR detected and read more text (especially in tricky layouts) that Tesseract missed[[19]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DObservations%3A). It handles oriented text (rotated/skewed) well, outputting rotated bounding boxes for words[[20]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DTesseract%2520seems%2520to%2520miss%2520text%2Cnot%2520straight%29%2520boxes), which means it’s good for things like scanned forms or images where text isn’t perfectly horizontal. Users report PaddleOCR as one of the most robust open solutions for multilingual and tricky inputs (some even find it rivals proprietary engines). **Speed**: Impressively, PaddleOCR offers lightweight model versions that are optimized – it can run in real-time on GPU and even on mobile/IoT devices[[5]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DPaddleOCR%2520). It’s been praised for being *lightweight and fast, suitable for real-time applications*[[21]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrengths%3A), especially if you use the smaller OCR model (there are various size tiers). On CPU-only, it’s slower than Tesseract for simple docs, but with a GPU it’s much faster per image. **Resource**: Using PaddleOCR effectively can benefit from a GPU (for the neural net). It’s still usable on CPU for smaller jobs, but for large batches a GPU or edge TPU significantly boosts throughput. Memory footprint depends on model size (the full multilingual model is heavier). **Open/Closed**: Open-source (Apache license). **Extras**: PaddleOCR provides coordinates for each text detection and has some layout analysis (it won’t classify a table vs paragraph, but it finds text boxes in order). It doesn’t inherently extract relationships (like form fields) – it’s focused on reading text and giving positions. In summary, PaddleOCR is a great choice when you need a **fast, highly accurate OCR in multiple languages** and can leverage modern hardware[[22]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrengths%3A). It outperforms older engines on complex layouts, though it doesn’t reach the structured data extraction capability of some cloud services without additional processing[[23]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWeaknesses%3A).
* **EasyOCR, MMOCR, and Others** – There are other open-source OCR projects. **EasyOCR** (by JaidedAI) is another Python OCR library supporting many languages. It’s easy to use but in many tests slightly trails PaddleOCR in accuracy and speed. **MMOCR** (by OpenMMLab) is a whole toolbox with multiple models for detection and recognition (including Transformers, etc.), suitable for research or advanced users. These can be quite accurate but also more complex to configure. In one comparison, EasyOCR and MMOCR performed decently, but PaddleOCR still had an edge in accuracy on a sample form (EasyOCR and Paddle both caught most text, but Paddle’s detection was a bit more precise)[[20]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DTesseract%2520seems%2520to%2520miss%2520text%2Cnot%2520straight%29%2520boxes). These tools also output bounding boxes. Generally, the **open-source landscape in 2025** shows that neural network-based OCR (PaddleOCR, MMOCR’s models, etc.) tend to outperform the older Tesseract on challenging inputs, especially for non-Latin scripts and unusual layouts. However, Tesseract remains competitive on clear printed text and uses fewer resources (no GPU needed).
* **Transformer-Based OCR Models** – These are often available open-source (usually via Hugging Face). Examples include **TrOCR** (Microsoft’s Transformer OCR) and **Donut** (NAVER’s OCR-free transformer). These represent the state-of-the-art in research. **TrOCR** uses a Vision Transformer encoder and a text decoder to read text end-to-end[[24]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Cby%2520Microsoft). It achieves excellent character accuracy, outperforming traditional OCR on difficult fonts or noisy images in studies[[25]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dachieves%2520higher%2520accuracy%2520than%2520traditional%2CIt%2520comes). It’s pre-trained on large data and can be fine-tuned for specific domains (including handwriting)[[26]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dinstance%2C%2520TrOCR%2520has%2520been%2520shown%2Ctuned%2520for%2520specific%2520domains). However, TrOCR alone doesn’t do layout analysis – it just gives you a sequence of text (no position information except what you infer by input order)[[27]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Ddocuments%2Cbased%2520sequence). It’s typically used on a single text line or cropped region; applying it to full pages requires a prior text detection step (to break the page into regions). **Speed/Resources**: being a Transformer model, TrOCR is heavier – for practical use one would use a GPU; on CPU it’s slow. It might not beat something like PaddleOCR in speed, but can in accuracy for certain tough cases. **Donut** goes a step further: it’s a Transformer that outputs structured data (or text) *without a separate OCR step*[[28]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DDonut%2520%2CNAVER%2520Clova%2C%2520Donut%2520utilizes%2520a)[[29]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dstep%2C%2520Donut%2520can%2520mitigate%2520error%2Ctrainable%2520approach%2520can%2520rival%2520traditional). You give it a document image, and if fine-tuned properly, it can directly produce, say, a JSON of field-value pairs from an invoice. Donut achieved **state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like SROIE (receipts)** by directly learning to parse the receipts into key fields[[13]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L162%2520step%2C%2520Donut%2Ctrainable%2520approach%2520can%2520rival%2520traditional). The advantage is it learns reading order and layout implicitly, potentially reducing error propagation (no separate detection stage)[[30]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dhuggingface%2CBy%2520avoiding%2520a%2520distinct%2520OCR). **Accuracy**: On tasks it’s trained for, Donut can be extremely accurate – often beating pipelines that do OCR then analysis. But it must be trained per task. Out-of-the-box, a generic Donut model can output plain text of a document, but it might need fine-tuning to handle a wide variety of layouts reliably. **Resource**: Donut is large (Transformer encoder-decoder) so it basically requires a GPU for inference to be anywhere near real-time. **Open/Closed**: Donut’s code and some models are open-source (from NAVER). Using it effectively usually means doing your own fine-tuning (which requires machine learning expertise and data). **Bounding boxes**: TrOCR and Donut as pure models do **not** provide coordinate info for each word – they “read” and output content. If you need bounding boxes, you’d pair them with a detection model or use a different approach. In summary, Transformer OCR models are **top-notch in accuracy** (especially for difficult documents or for structured output when trained) but come with high computational cost and complexity. They are overkill for simple tasks but powerful for specialized ones.

### Cloud-Based OCR and Document AI Services

Major cloud providers offer OCR services that not only perform text recognition but also provide structured outputs and integrate into broader workflows. These are closed-source (proprietary) and require API calls (internet access), but they leverage very advanced models under the hood and are continually updated. The top ones in 2025 include **Google Document AI (Vision OCR)**, **Amazon Textract**, **Microsoft Azure Form Recognizer (Document Intelligence)**, **Adobe PDF Extract**, and newer services like **Mistral OCR**. Here’s a breakdown:

* **Google Cloud Vision / Document AI** – Google’s OCR is often regarded as an industry leader in accuracy. In a 2025 benchmark, Google’s OCR had the highest overall text accuracy (~98%) on a mixed dataset of printed, complex, and handwritten docs[[8]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dachieves%2520extremely%2520high%2520text%2520recognition%2CIt%2520handled%2520difficult). It reliably handles difficult cases (multiple fonts, rotated text, etc.), and supports an enormous range of languages (over 200 languages for text recognition)[[31]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3D200%2B%2520language%2520cloud). **Accuracy**: Essentially state-of-the-art for general OCR – it’s rare for it to miss clear text. It also has a handwriting mode supporting ~50 languages[[31]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3D200%2B%2520language%2520cloud). **Structured extraction**: Google’s Document AI platform goes beyond raw OCR – it provides pretrained parsers for forms, invoices, receipts, passports, tax documents, etc.[[32]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DBeyond%2520raw%2520OCR%2C%2520Google%2520Document%2CThese%2520models%2520leverage%2520Google%25E2%2580%2599s). For example, the invoice model will directly give you a JSON with fields like vendor name, invoice number, line items, totals, etc. This is powered by Google’s combination of vision and language AI. If you just use the raw OCR (Google Vision API), you get text with **bounding boxes**, and an optional *layout* grouping (it identifies paragraphs, breaks, etc.). If you use Document AI specialized models, you get higher-level JSON (entities and fields). **Speed**: Google’s API is quite fast (processing a single page often in a second or two). It can handle bulk throughput by scaling on their side – you send many requests in parallel. **Resource**: Since it’s cloud, you don’t worry about local resource beyond sending data; however, you pay per page processed. For very large jobs, cost can accumulate. **Output format**: Typically JSON or XML with text and coordinates. **Open/Closed**: Closed source (paid service). **Special notes**: Google’s OCR is known for maintaining layout reading order well and even detecting some document structure like tables (though it may not output full HTML, it does give cell bounding boxes for tables). With the Document AI form parsers, it’s one of the most *comprehensive* solutions (from raw text to structured data)[[32]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DBeyond%2520raw%2520OCR%2C%2520Google%2520Document%2CThese%2520models%2520leverage%2520Google%25E2%2580%2599s)[[33]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dsolution%2Cmany%2520enterprise%2520document%2520processing%2520need). Many enterprises choose it if they need top accuracy and have multilingual needs, and are okay with cloud deployment.
* **Amazon Textract** – AWS’s OCR service, focused on forms and business documents. **Accuracy**: Very high on printed text – on par with Google in many cases (95–99% accuracy on standard documents)[[34]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L310%2520benchmarked%2520to%2CIn%2520difficult%2520cases%2520%28like). It also can handle handwriting (English, and recently expanded to other languages to a limited extent). Textract is particularly tuned for forms and tables: it not only extracts text, but also identifies **key-value pairs** (for form fields) and table structures. For example, given a form, it might return "Key": "First Name", "Value": "John" with positions[[35]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3D). **Structured output**: Textract’s JSON output includes blocks for lines, words, with coordinates, plus separate sections for detected form fields and tables (with cell coordinates)[[35]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3D). This is extremely useful for info extraction, as you directly know what text was in each table cell or which text was the answer to which question on a form. **Speed**: Similar to Google – quite fast per page, and AWS can scale to large batch jobs (they even have an asynchronous batch API for big jobs). **Resource**: Cloud-managed (no local resource needed, but cost per page applies). **Language support**: This is a known limitation – Textract historically focused on English and a handful of Western languages. As of 2025 it supports around 6-10 languages (mainly Latin script: English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, etc.)[[36]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DCloud%2520API%2520). It’s not as multilingual as Google or Azure. If you feed it a document in an unsupported language (e.g. Chinese), it might not work well or at all. **Strengths**: Textract shines in reading complex layouts like tables, forms and maintaining structure. It’s integrated with AWS’s ecosystem, so you can pipe results into databases or further analysis easily[[3]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrengths%3A). **Weaknesses**: You cannot fine-tune it – it’s a fixed service (no custom training on new document types)[[37]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L1856%2520Custom%2520Training%2CN/A%2520N/A%2520High%2520High%2520High). And, as noted, limited language range and some complexity if documents have mix of languages or unusual layouts (it expects documents, not scene photos). Overall, Textract is a top choice for **business documents in supported languages**, offering near-human accuracy and rich output for forms and tables[[3]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrengths%3A)[[38]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520summary%2C%2520Amazon%2520Textract%2520offers%2Ccomplexity%2520of%2520handling%2520documents%2520with).
* **Azure Document Intelligence (Form Recognizer)** – Microsoft’s Azure offers a service originally known as Form Recognizer, now under the umbrella of Azure Document Intelligence. It combines OCR with pre-trained models and custom model capabilities. **Accuracy**: Also very high – Azure’s OCR engine itself is on par with Google/AWS on clear text (in one category of a benchmark it even scored ~99.8% on printed text)[[39]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L228%2520%2Cthe%2520third%2520category%2520and%2520total). However, historically Azure’s handwriting OCR wasn’t as strong, which could reduce accuracy on documents with mixed print/handwriting[[40]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Cthe%2520third%2520category%2520and%2520total). That said, Azure continuously improves this and also supports a separate handwriting recognition for certain languages. **Features**: Azure provides *prebuilt models* for things like invoices, receipts, business cards, ID cards, and others[[41]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWhere%2520Azure%2520Form%2520Recognizer%2520shines%2Cprebuilt%2520invoice%2520model%2C%2520for%2520example). These models will extract fields similar to Google’s specialized parsers. It also has a general layout model that gives you text lines, tables, etc. A standout feature is **custom training**: you can upload a bunch of your own documents (e.g., specific forms) and label the fields, and Azure will train a custom model to extract those fields on similar docs[[42]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrong%2520OCR%2520for%2520print/handwritin%2520unstract%2Ccom). This is incredibly useful for specialized use-cases – you don’t need to build an ML model from scratch; Azure will fine-tune one for you with just a small sample (5-10 labeled examples can often suffice)[[42]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrong%2520OCR%2520for%2520print/handwritin%2520unstract%2Ccom). **Output**: JSON that includes text and bounding boxes, plus structured results (tables as arrays, key-value pairs, etc.)[[43]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAnother%2520strength%2520of%2520Azure%2520Form%2Can%2520array%2520of%2520rows%2520and)[[44]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dfew%2520sample%2520unstract). They also preserve table structure nicely – each cell’s text is grouped properly[[43]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAnother%2520strength%2520of%2520Azure%2520Form%2Can%2520array%2520of%2520rows%2520and). **Language**: Azure OCR supports printed text in over 100 languages (leveraging their Read OCR service), and for the structured models, they support a smaller set (for example, the invoice model supports English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and more – around 15 languages including some East Asian like Chinese/Japanese for certain models)[[45]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DCloud%2520API%2520). **Speed**: Cloud-scale similar to others. **Resource/Cost**: Paid per request/page, and requires internet; latency is usually low. **Open/Closed**: Closed source. **Use cases**: Azure is often chosen by enterprises who need **both** off-the-shelf OCR and the ability to **train custom models** for their documents, all within a secure cloud. It’s very strong in table extraction and form understanding[[43]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DAnother%2520strength%2520of%2520Azure%2520Form%2Can%2520array%2520of%2520rows%2520and)[[46]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520summary%2C%2520Azure%2520Form%2520Recognizer%2Csuited%2520for%2520organizations). One caveat is that, like other clouds, if you have extremely sensitive data and cannot use cloud, this might be a barrier (though Azure does offer on-prem containers for Form Recognizer in some cases). In summary, Azure’s solution provides robust OCR, advanced structured data extraction, and unique flexibility via custom training[[41]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWhere%2520Azure%2520Form%2520Recognizer%2520shines%2Cprebuilt%2520invoice%2520model%2C%2520for%2520example)[[47]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520summary%2C%2520Azure%2520Form%2520Recognizer%2Csuited%2520for%2520organizations).
* **Adobe PDF Extract API** – Adobe, being the creator of PDF, offers a cloud service to extract content from PDFs. Its approach is slightly different: **if a PDF is born-digital, it will directly extract the text and layout from the file (no OCR needed)**, which means perfect accuracy on those parts[[4]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dcommunity.adobe.com.%2520This%2520preserves%2520100%2Cservice%2520will%2520apply%2520OCR%2520automaticall). For scanned parts, it applies Adobe’s OCR (Adobe’s Acrobat OCR is known to be very accurate as well, although Adobe doesn’t publish exact numbers)[[48]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DIn%2520terms%2520of%2520OCR%2520accuracy%2Cwide%2520range%2520of%2520languages%2C%2520so). Adobe’s focus is on preserving the exact structure and content: it outputs a JSON (and associated files) that contain the text with styling, layout structure (headings, paragraphs, list items), table data as CSV, and even images extracted[[49]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DLeverages%2520native%2520PDF%2520text%2520if%2Ccom). Essentially, it tries to rebuild a logical representation of the PDF. **Accuracy**: For digital text, 100% (since it’s not guessing, it’s reading the PDF’s text layer)[[4]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dcommunity.adobe.com.%2520This%2520preserves%2520100%2Cservice%2520will%2520apply%2520OCR%2520automaticall). For OCR on scanned content, it’s very high (Acrobat’s OCR engine has been refined over years, often on par with other top engines). It supports many languages as Acrobat does. **Speed**: It’s a cloud API, so similar order of magnitude to others per page. **Resource**: No local resource, but it’s a paid service. **Unique capabilities**: It identifies things like reading order (which is tricky in PDFs) and basic semantic roles (title, heading, etc.)[[49]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DLeverages%2520native%2520PDF%2520text%2520if%2Ccom). It’s particularly useful if you want to **repurpose PDF content** (like convert a PDF to HTML or feed it to an NLP pipeline with structure intact). It even can attach images (figures in the PDF) alongside the text. **Openness**: Closed, though the PDF Extract API is accessible to developers through Adobe’s cloud. **When to use**: If your PDFs are a mix of digital and scanned and you need a richly structured output (not just plain text), Adobe’s solution excels. For example, converting academic papers or product manuals where preserving headings, lists, tables, and figures is important – this API will yield better structured output than raw OCR from others[[49]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DLeverages%2520native%2520PDF%2520text%2520if%2Ccom). However, it’s not as specialized in extracting key pairs or performing field recognition – it gives you structure, but you would have to interpret that structure if looking for specific info.
* **Mistral OCR** – A newer entrant (as of 2025) is Mistral OCR, from a company focusing on document AI. It’s notable for being a **multimodal model** that reads documents and outputs *Markdown* (or JSON) with both text and images in place[[50]](https://www.cohorte.co/blog/mistral-ocr-a-deep-dive-into-next-generation-document-understanding%23%3A~%3Atext%3DMistral%2520OCR%2520is%2520shaking%2520up%2Clayout%2520preservation%2C%2520and%2520multimodal%2520understanding)[[51]](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/7/mistral-ocr/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DMistral%2520OCR%2520%2CMarkdown%2520with%2520optional%2520embedded%2520images). Essentially, if you feed a PDF to Mistral, it can produce an output that retains the layout and even embeds graphics/formulas as images. It aims to comprehend each element of a document – text, tables, figures, etc. – with “unprecedented accuracy” as per its marketing[[52]](https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ocr%23%3A~%3Atext%3DUnlike%2520other%2520models%2C%2520Mistral%2520OCR%2Cequations%25E2%2580%2594with%2520unprecedented%2520accuracy%2520and%2520cognition). **Accuracy**: Mistral claims state-of-the-art accuracy. Independent tests showed it performing highly on structured documents. For example, it was reported to read dense scientific content with excellent accuracy and preserve context and layout[[53]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmistral%2Cto%2520be%2520%25E2%2580%259CHigh%25E2%2580%259D%2520on%2520structured). It was even touted as beating Azure and Google on certain benchmarks in internal tests. However, one evaluation noted it struggled with some cursive handwriting and very disorganized layouts[[54]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DWe%2520were%2520surprised%2520by%2520Mistral%2Cthose%2520containing%2520multiple%2520font%2520styles) – perhaps indicating it’s strong but not infallible. **Output**: By using Markdown (with text content and images), it preserves layout in a human-readable way[[55]](https://medium.com/%40Klippa/mistral-ocr-for-document-processing-the-good-the-bad-the-reality-42bf0e170529%23%3A~%3Atext%3DMistral%2520OCR%2520is%2520an%2520optical%2Cfriendly%2520formatting). E.g., a formula might appear as an embedded image and paragraphs as text. This is useful if you want to parse or display the document content with formatting. **Speed**: Mistral is optimized for speed – reports suggest it’s one of the fastest high-accuracy OCR models[[56]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DMultilingual%2520%28built). It likely uses a heavy model under the hood but possibly has optimized inference (and possibly uses GPU on their side). **Resource**: It’s offered as a service (either SaaS or a private on-prem appliance for enterprise). For an end user, that means you don’t directly handle the resource, but it’s not free. **Open/Closed**: It is closed-source and a paid product (not to be confused with open-source “Mistral” language model; this is a specific OCR product by a company). **Use case**: Mistral OCR is pitched for advanced documents – think complex reports, academic papers, things where you want not just the text but the whole document *understood* and output in a structured way[[57]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L235%2520art%2520in%2Cpowerful%2520option%2520for%2520advanced%2520use). If you needed to, say, feed an entire PDF (with text, tables, charts) into a downstream AI or search engine while preserving structure, this could be a solution. Because it’s new, users would want to verify its claims on their documents. It may not yet have the proven track record of Google/AWS. Also, being closed, one is dependent on that vendor. But it represents where the state of the art is heading: **multi-modal understanding** rather than just text extraction.
* **Others (ABBYY, etc.)**: There are also traditional commercial OCR engines like **ABBYY FineReader** (a software that can be used via GUI or SDK). ABBYY has long been known for high OCR accuracy and layout retention. It’s an on-premise solution (you install it on your machine or server). Accuracy-wise, ABBYY is comparable to top cloud OCR for print – often in the 98-99% range for good quality documents. It also has table and form recognition features, and supports many languages. Resource-wise, it can use CPU (and I believe GPU in newer versions) and can be scaled by running multiple instances. It’s closed-source and requires purchasing licenses. While not as frequently cited in 2025 tech discussions (since cloud and open-source AI have gained traction), ABBYY remains a strong choice if you need **offline, enterprise-grade OCR** with a polished toolset. Similarly, **Google Tesseract 5 (if any updates)** and emerging local models might provide incremental improvements.

**Summary of Accuracy & Features**: In general, for pure text accuracy on printed material, most top solutions (open-source and cloud) are now very close – as noted, >95% is common[[1]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Cto%2520~96), and the best achieve ~98-99% on clean text[[8]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dachieves%2520extremely%2520high%2520text%2520recognition%2CIt%2520handled%2520difficult). The differences show up with *difficult inputs*: e.g., faint scans, unusual fonts, or layout complexity (columns, tables, forms, handwriting). Cloud services (Google, AWS, Azure) and advanced models (PaddleOCR, Transformers) handle these better than vanilla Tesseract. For instance, Google and AWS had the lowest error rates on a mixed dataset, especially when handwriting was involved[[58]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DGoogle%2520Cloud%2520Platform%25E2%2580%2599s%2520Vision%2520OCR%2Creal%2520difference%2520between%2520the%2520products). Tesseract and some others fell behind when faced with scanned handwriting or very complex layouts[[59]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L278%2520perform%2520above%2Cthem%2520behind%2520in%2520this%2520comparison). As such, if **accuracy** is the absolute priority (and especially if you need **bounding boxes and layout**), the cloud APIs currently have an edge, as they leverage deep learning and huge training sets – Google Vision and AWS Textract were identified as the top two in overall text accuracy in one analysis[[60]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3DImage%3A%2520OCR%2520accuracy%2520benchmark%2520of%2Ctop%2520OCR%2520companies)[[61]](https://research.aimultiple.com/ocr-accuracy/%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L260%2520an%2520almost%2Cin%2520terms%2520of%2520text%2520accuracy). But the gap isn’t huge for normal documents, and open solutions are catching up.

**Speed and Throughput**: Traditional OCR (Tesseract) can be faster on CPU for simple tasks (since it’s lighter), but modern DL models on GPU can process pages very quickly as well (e.g., PaddleOCR or a CNN-based model might process an image in 100ms on a GPU). Cloud services usually impose some rate limits but internally are highly optimized. For very high volume, one consideration is the overhead of API calls (network latency can add up). Self-hosted solutions might achieve higher throughput if you can parallelize them on multiple GPUs/servers. For example, an organization processing millions of pages per day might set up a cluster of machines running PaddleOCR or use a distributed Tesseract farm. Cloud providers can also batch process asynchronously, but cost may be a factor.

**Resource Requirements**: On this front: - **Tesseract**: CPU only, low RAM (maybe a few hundred MB per process), no special hardware needed. Can even run on mobile (though slower). - **PaddleOCR/EasyOCR**: Can utilize GPU (requires CUDA etc. if using GPU). On CPU, they need more power than Tesseract (for neural network inference) and more memory for the models. PaddleOCR’s smallest models are a few MB and can even run on mobile devices (they have mobile-optimized versions)[[5]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DPaddleOCR%2520), whereas the large models could be hundreds of MB. - **Transformers (TrOCR/Donut)**: Very heavy – model sizes in hundreds of MB to a few GB. They essentially **require** a modern GPU with a lot of VRAM for efficient inference (especially Donut). Running these on CPU is possible but extremely slow (seconds per line or more). - **Cloud (Google/Azure/AWS)**: No local hardware needed, but you need a stable internet connection. The heavy lifting is on the provider side (they use their TPUs/GPUs). The “resource” consideration here is more about **cost** and **data security**. Cost can range from fractions of a cent to a few cents per page depending on the service and volume; for millions of pages, this becomes significant. Also, some applications cannot send data to cloud for privacy or compliance reasons – in those cases, cloud is off the table regardless of accuracy. - **Adobe API**: Also cloud, but one interesting resource aspect is that by using native PDF text when available, it avoids doing OCR for those parts – effectively *saving processing*. If you have a lot of digital PDFs, Adobe’s approach might be faster and more accurate by design for those, since it’s not converting text to image and back. - **Mistral**: Provided as either cloud or possibly on-prem appliance with hefty hardware. It’s specialized, so likely organizations would run it on a dedicated server with GPUs if used internally. - **Memory & Disk**: Solutions that output more structure might produce larger output (e.g., Adobe’s JSON with all elements, or Mistral’s markdown). Storing those results takes more space than just plain text. Minor issue, but if extracting millions of pages, consider storage for outputs.

**Bounding Boxes and Layout**: Most solutions today **do** provide bounding boxes: - Tesseract: via hOCR or ALTO XML outputs (you get coordinates for each word/line)[[15]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dto%2520improve%2520recognition%2520unstract). - PaddleOCR/EasyOCR: yes, they have detection, so you get coordinates for each text segment. - Cloud services: absolutely – Google, AWS, Azure all give coordinates for words/lines and often higher-level groupings (paragraphs, form fields, cells). For example, AWS’s JSON explicitly maps out table cell coordinates and form field bounding boxes. - Transformer OCR (TrOCR): by itself no (just text), but you could combine with a detection model to get boxes. - Donut: not directly, but if it outputs structured JSON, you might not need coordinates because it gives semantic structure. Still, if knowing *where* something was on the page is needed, Donut alone won’t tell you. - Mistral: yes, indirectly – because it outputs markdown with images, one could infer positions in a relative sense (and it likely encodes positional info in how it formats content). It’s aimed at preserving layout visually. - Adobe: yes, it provides coordinates and even dimensions for elements in the JSON, since it’s meant to reconstruct the layout.

In summary, **for general-purpose use** (as the user asks), the top approaches tend to combine methods: you might use a fast open-source OCR for bulk text extraction, but use a cloud or advanced model for specific documents where higher fidelity or structure is needed. The good news is that even the free tools are quite capable now for basic needs, while the advanced ones can tackle the really hard problems albeit with more resources and cost.

## Fine-Tuning and Customization for Specialized Use-Cases

Many of these OCR and extraction solutions can be **fine-tuned or customized** to better handle specialized document types (like SEC filings, medical forms, etc.). Fine-tuning can significantly boost accuracy on domain-specific formats or jargon, but the approach and tools differ depending on the solution:

* **Open-Source Neural OCR (PaddleOCR, MMOCR, etc.)**: These provide the ability to train your own models. For example, PaddleOCR includes tools for training new text detection or recognition models on your data[[62]](https://toon-beerten.medium.com/ocr-comparison-tesseract-versus-easyocr-vs-paddleocr-vs-mmocr-a362d9c79e66%23%3A~%3Atext%3DMultilingual%2520OCR%2520toolkits%2520based%2520on%2Cmobile%2C%2520embedded%2520and%2520IoT%2520devices). If you had a very specialized font or scanning condition (say camera images of receipts under low light), you could collect labeled data and fine-tune the recognition model to that. This requires machine learning expertise and a GPU, but is doable. Similarly, MMOCR or Keras-OCR allow training on custom datasets. **Resource needs**: a labeled dataset of images to text, and time on a GPU to train (could be hours to days depending on data size). The benefit is an OCR model tailored to your exact use-case (e.g., reading CAT scan reports with certain layouts, or historical documents with old fonts). There are also community-trained models (for example, models fine-tuned for specific scripts or tasks that you can find on Hugging Face).
* **Tesseract**: While not a neural net in the same way, Tesseract can be trained on new data as well. It supports training from scratch or adapting to new characters. For instance, if you need to OCR old English fraktur text, you can train Tesseract on examples of that font[[16]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dmatch%2520at%2520L263%2520%2Ccustomizable%2520for%2520specialized%2520OCR%2520needs). This is a bit involved (preparing training images and box files), but many have done it. Tesseract’s training toolchain allows improving accuracy on things like handwriting too, though success varies (handwriting is generally better tackled with neural nets). If your use-case is something like *“improve OCR on SEC filings which use a very small font and have specific tables”*, one could conceivably fine-tune Tesseract by providing it those PDFs and ground truth text to learn the idiosyncrasies (though in practice, it might be easier to fine-tune a modern model or just use layout-aware processing).
* **Transformer Models (LayoutLM, Donut, etc.)**: These are *highly amenable to fine-tuning.* In fact, fine-tuning is the expected way to use them for information extraction. For example, **LayoutLMv2** (a Microsoft model that takes text + layout as input) was pre-trained on millions of documents and then can be fine-tuned for tasks like field extraction or classification[[12]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3Ddocument%2520classification%2C%2520or%2520question%2Cthan%2520just%2520looking%2520for%2520keywords). If you have a set of SEC filings with certain sections you care about, you could fine-tune LayoutLM to classify each text segment into categories (Management Discussion, Financial Statement, etc.) or to tag specific entities (like Revenue, Net Income values). There’s research showing fine-tuning language models for SEC filings format understanding – e.g., a 2024 study introduced a “SEC-former” model specialized for SEC 10-K report structure[[63]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378505969_Language_Models_Fine-Tuning_for_Automatic_Format_Reconstruction_of_SEC_Financial_Filings%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dand%2520Autoencoders%2Cof%2520the%2520documents%2520as%2520a). They fine-tuned transformer models to identify sections of SEC reports and reconstruct a standard format, demonstrating improved results on that domain. This indicates that taking a pre-trained model and specializing it for SEC filings is not only possible but actively being done in research[[63]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378505969_Language_Models_Fine-Tuning_for_Automatic_Format_Reconstruction_of_SEC_Financial_Filings%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dand%2520Autoencoders%2Cof%2520the%2520documents%2520as%2520a).
* **Tools needed**: Typically, one would use a deep learning framework (PyTorch or TensorFlow) and libraries like Hugging Face Transformers to fine-tune models like LayoutLM, TrOCR, or Donut. You also need labeled data: for SEC filings, one might label a few reports with the target information (e.g., highlight where each important section or figure is). There are annotation tools (like Label Studio or Adobe Acrobat for tagging text) to prepare such data. Once fine-tuned, the model can be deployed to extract that info from new filings with higher accuracy than a generic model could.
* **Example**: Suppose you want to extract all Risk Factors from 10-K filings. A generic OCR will just give raw text, and a generic NLP might not segment it well. But you could fine-tune a model to recognize the "Risk Factors" section by training it on a few labeled filings. After that, the model could directly split out that section’s text from any new 10-K. This kind of targeted fine-tuning can greatly ease downstream analysis. The trade-off is the effort to create training data and the need for ML expertise.
* **Cloud Services with Custom Training**: Among the big three, **Azure Form Recognizer** stands out for allowing custom model training with relative ease. You don’t code a neural network; instead, you upload sample documents and label them via their interface or PDF labeling tool (indicating, for example, “this number is the Total Assets in the balance sheet”). Azure will then train a model behind the scenes to extract those fields from similar docs[[42]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3DStrong%2520OCR%2520for%2520print/handwritin%2520unstract%2Ccom). This is very useful for cases like custom forms or reports. For SEC filings, one could train a custom model to extract key financial fields or sections by labeling a handful of filings. The requirement is that the documents should be somewhat consistent in format (which, for SEC filings, they often are standardized to a degree, though companies have their own styles as the research noted[[64]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378505969_Language_Models_Fine-Tuning_for_Automatic_Format_Reconstruction_of_SEC_Financial_Filings%23%3A~%3Atext%3Dregulators%2C%2520especially%2520the%2520mandatory%2520annual%2Cbased%2520approaches%29%2520to%2520automatically)). The **tools** here are simply the Azure portal or SDK – Microsoft handles the ML part. Similarly, **Google’s AutoML Document AI** (part of Document AI) allows custom training: you provide examples of a new doc type (like your own form), label the fields, and it fine-tunes a model for you. These services abstract away the ML details, so a domain expert can create a custom extractor without writing ML code.
* Note: AWS Textract currently doesn’t offer custom training for their OCR – you get what Amazon provides. They do have a feature called “Queries” where you can ask for specific information (like “what is the total amount?” on an invoice) which uses some AI under the hood, but you can’t train it on new document types from scratch. If customization is needed on AWS, one might need to use Amazon Augmented AI or bring in their own model.
* **Fine-tuning for OCR vs for Info Extraction**: It’s worth distinguishing: fine-tuning an **OCR engine** (like training it to recognize new characters or improve base text extraction) versus fine-tuning an **information extraction model** that uses OCR output. The latter is often more feasible for specialized cases. For example, you likely wouldn’t try to fine-tune Google’s OCR itself (you can’t, it’s closed), but you might OCR an SEC filing and then use an NLP model to parse the text. Tools like **spaCy** or **Hugging Face transformers** can be fine-tuned for NER (to tag financial terms) or classification (to label sentences or sections). In many cases, that is sufficient: run a general OCR to get text, then apply a fine-tuned NLP model to get the info you need. This avoids dealing with the image level altogether and leverages the fact that most filings are digitally available (so OCR errors are minimal if text is embedded, or manageable if high-quality scans).
* **Examples of specialized fine-tuning**: Aside from the SEC example, consider healthcare: one could fine-tune LayoutLM on annotated medical forms to extract patient info. Or in finance, fine-tune a model on annual reports to extract tables of financial metrics. Another route is using **LLMs with prompt engineering** – not exactly fine-tuning, but for instance, one could feed the text of a document to GPT-4 (with vision, if needed, or after OCR) and use cleverly crafted prompts or few-shot examples to have it extract what you want (like “Here is a financial report, output a JSON of key financial figures”). This is more *prompt-tuning* than model fine-tuning, but it’s a way to adapt a general model to a task. It doesn’t guarantee 100% accuracy and might not be as reliable as a fine-tuned smaller model, but it’s a quick way to get results without needing a training dataset, leveraging the knowledge in a large model.
* **Limits and tools for fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning requires data. For SEC filings, if one wanted to fine-tune a model, they might leverage publicly available filings (EDGAR database) to create a training set. There are projects and papers that have done things like segment filings into sections or extract specific tables. These could provide starting datasets. Tools like **Hugging Face’s Trainer** or Azure’s Form Recognizer Studio are enablers. Also, there are specialized libraries like **LayoutLMv3** (which even integrates optical features) – fine-tuning those might need PyTorch and perhaps GPU with ~24GB memory for larger models.
* **Expectations**: Fine-tuning can significantly improve accuracy for niche tasks. E.g., a generic OCR might get 90% of an SEC table right, but a fine-tuned model could push that to 98% by being aware of the structure and terminology (knowing to expect certain financial terms, etc.). Fine-tuning can also enable **new capabilities** – e.g., training a Donut model to directly output a well-structured JSON from a filing (maybe categorizing each note in the financial statement into predefined fields). The potential is there, and 2025 has seen many frameworks making it easier (like document AI libraries and even no-code tools like Unstructured or Unstract’s platform that allow some level of model customization for documents).

In conclusion, **specialized fine-tuning is not only possible but increasingly common**. Open-source models give full control to train on your data, while cloud services offer user-friendly custom model training for specific document types. For something like SEC filings, one might start by seeing if a prebuilt model (like a general form recognizer) works well; if not, consider fine-tuning a layout-aware model on annotated filings. The tools needed range from ML libraries (for a DIY approach) to cloud AutoML services (for a simplified approach). With the right fine-tuning, you can push the performance beyond out-of-the-box solutions – extracting precisely the information you care about with higher accuracy than a one-size-fits-all OCR would achieve[[65]](https://unstract.com/blog/best-pdf-ocr-software/%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2Ccustomizable%2520for%2520specialized%2520OCR%2520needs)[[66]](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/ai-ocr-models-pdf-structured-text-comparison%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%2COCR%2520support).
