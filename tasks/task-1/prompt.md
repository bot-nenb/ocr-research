Read the contents of synthesis/UPDATED_DEMO_TASKS.md. Now create a detailed to-do list for building demo 1. This list should follow the following requirements. Install the Python environment using uv only. DO NOT USE pip. The demo will be built on a machine with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system. It will only have access to the CPU when building the demo, and will not have access to the GPU. But you should design the demo so that it can also be run on GPU in the future. And for now just ignore the OLMoCR use-case as it requires GPU. Store the information in tasks/task-1/to-do.md.
