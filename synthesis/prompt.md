In the research/ subdirectory there are three subdirectories: claude, gpt-5 and gemini-25-pro. Each subdirectory contains a prompt that these models were asked to answer, along with a separate file that contains the answer. Each model answer will have biases and factual inaccuracies. Your job is to analyse the output from all models, and create a new document that summarises the areas where there is consensus between the three models. Consensus is defined as at least two models having the same recommendation. After you have created this document, re-read it and check the results against the original documents. If you spot that you have made errors, fix them. Repeat until you are happy. Add your results to the synthesis/ subdirectory.
