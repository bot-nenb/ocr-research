Read the consensus report in the synthesis subdirectory. This is the basis for your next task. However, there has been an important update to the information in this report. A new report is available at https://blog.roboflow.com/best-ocr-models-text-recognition/. You should update your knowledge to reflect this new information. With your updated knowledge, I now want you to sketch a list of tasks for creating demos for the various use-cases identified in the original report. The demos should not be too complex and should try to illustrate the key requirement of each use-case. For example, for a batch processing example, the demo could build on a open-source model as closed-source models will likely be too expensive to use. And the demo could also use a small benchmark dataset to illustrate that the open-source model can perform reasonably well and not be too slow. I would also like to have a demo for an open-source LLM that perhaps can be used to illustrate situations where it is more accurate (but potentially slower and more expensive to run). All demos will be run in Python. Place the results in the actions subdirectory.
