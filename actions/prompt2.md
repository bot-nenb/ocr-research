There have been two further updates. First, I want you to read https://huggingface.co/blog/manu/colpali. Now I want you to update UPDATED_DEMO_TASKS.md to include a task that is relevant to the information in this blog. You can either add a new task or modify an existing task - whatever you think is more appropriate. The second update is that I have now been told that there is an interesting model available at https://olmocr.allenai.org/. Investigate this model using this website and any information that you think relevant. Finally update UPDATED_DEMO_TASKS.md with the information that you have learned. You can either add a new task or modify an existing task - whatever you think is more appropriate.
